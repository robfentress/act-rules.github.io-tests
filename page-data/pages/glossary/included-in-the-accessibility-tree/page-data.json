An example of this is a <a href=\"#focusable\">focusable</a> element with an <code class=\"language-text\">aria-hidden</code> attribute with a value of <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>. Such an element could still be interacted with using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Included in the accessibility tree"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ACT-Rules Community","keywords":["WCAG","ACT Rules","Accessibility","W3C"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"pages/glossary/included-in-the-accessibility-tree/","fileName":null,"sourceInstanceName":"pages","markdownType":"glossary","fastmatterAttributes":"{\"title\":\"Included in the accessibility tree\",\"key\":\"included-in-the-accessibility-tree\"}","changelog":null,"title":"Included in the accessibility tree","ruleType":null}}}
