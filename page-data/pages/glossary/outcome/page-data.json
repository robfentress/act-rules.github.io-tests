An outcome can be one of the three following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inapplicable:</strong> No part of the test subject matches the applicability</li>\n<li><strong>Passed:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target\">test target</a> meets all expectations</li>\n<li><strong>Failed:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target\">test target</a> does not meet all expectations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A rule has one <code class=\"language-text\">passed</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">failed</code> outcome for every <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target\">test target</a>. When there are no test targets the rule has one <code class=\"language-text\">inapplicable</code> outcome. This means that each <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject\">test subject</a> will have one or more outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementers using the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/\">EARL10-Schema</a> can express the outcome with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome\">outcome property</a>. In addition to <code class=\"language-text\">passed</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">failed</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">inapplicable</code>, EARL 1.0 also defined an <code class=\"language-text\">incomplete</code> outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such \"interim\" results can be expressed with the <code class=\"language-text\">incomplete</code> outcome.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Outcome"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ACT-Rules Community","keywords":["WCAG","ACT Rules","Accessibility","W3C"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"pages/glossary/outcome/","fileName":null,"sourceInstanceName":"pages","markdownType":"glossary","fastmatterAttributes":"{\"title\":\"Outcome\",\"key\":\"outcome\"}","changelog":null,"title":"Outcome","ruleType":null}}}
