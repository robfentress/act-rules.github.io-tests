This can be due to URL parsing, server settings, redirects and DNS aliasing.</p>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/infrastructure.html#parsing-urls\">parsed URLs</a> for two resources are identical, the resources are the same resource.</p>\n<p>Depending on the server, URLs can either be case-sensitive or case-insenstive, meaning that <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a href=&quot;page1.html&quot;&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a href=&quot;Page1.html&quot;&gt;</code> lead to either the same or two different pages.</p>\n<p>Fully parsed URLs can be different, but still lead to the same resource after making the HTTP request, due to redirects and DNS aliasing. For example, these URLs are all fully normalised: <a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a>, <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">http://www.example.com/</a>, <a href=\"https://www.example.com/\">https://www.example.com/</a>. The server can however be configured to serve the same site for http and https, and the same site for example.com and www.example.com. This is common, but not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Some types of redirects are also caused by user agents, e.g. ensuring that <a href=\"http://example.com/\">http://example.com/</a> and <a href=\"http://example.com\">http://example.com</a> resolve to the same resource.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Same resource"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ACT-Rules Community","keywords":["WCAG","ACT Rules","Accessibility","W3C"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"pages/glossary/same-resource/","fileName":null,"sourceInstanceName":"pages","markdownType":"glossary","fastmatterAttributes":"{\"title\":\"Same resource\",\"key\":\"same-resource\"}","changelog":null,"title":"Same resource","ruleType":null}}}
