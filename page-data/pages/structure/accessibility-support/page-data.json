Specifically ACT-Rules Community's testing rules are defined by the current specifications for WCAG2, HTML4, HTML5, (CSS3 ?) and ARIA1.</p>\n<p>As this effort matures and new technologies reach CR, they will included/added to data that governs the test rules.</p>\n<p>Note that as these new CR specs (HTML5, ARIA1) gain wider support on the web, the WCAG Working Group at the same time, regularly releases (approx. every 6 months) both the WCAG 2 Techniques/Failures and Understanding WCAG 2 documents, with new content that is relevant to those newer specs. Additionally the new content and techniques address previous poorly supported disability groups (Cognitive) as well as changing technology delivery methods (Mobile).</p>\n<p>\"Accessibility supported\" relates to support by user agents (including assistive technologies) of particular ways of using Web technologies.
